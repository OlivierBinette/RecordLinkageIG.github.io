Welcome! This is the blog of the American Statistical Association's Record Linkage Interest Group (RLIG).


If you are interested in deterministic and probabilistic record linkage, entity resolution, data fusion, or statistical matching, then this is for you. We hope you become a member of RLIG (it's free) to stay up to date with news and events in our community. You can learn more on our main website at [https://sites.google.com/view/ensitive to braking and accelerating, but once I figured that out it was, in my opinion, pretty straight f...rlig/](https://sites.google.com/view/rlig/).

We hope this blog will help foster community within RLIG. We encourage everyone to contribute. Posts can be short, such as to share interesting papers and associated thoughts, or they can be longer to go into any topic you find interesting. You can comment on posts to get in touch with their authors.

First and foremost, we want this blog to be a welcoming place for all. There is no "right" way to write posts -- express yourself as you like. We want to hear your unique perspective. Reply to comments, welcome feedback, and make connections!

Instructions to write blog posts are available on the [Contribute](https://recordlinkageig.gitub.io/contribute.html) page. It might seem a bit overwhelming if you have not worked with these tools before. However, we are here to help. If you'd like to post something but don't want to use R, we'll create the post for you. If you're unsure about any of the steps below, get in touch and we'll provide support. Contact me, [Olivier Binette](https://olivierbinette.github.io/), for any question. I'll be more than happy to help you contribute to the blog.
